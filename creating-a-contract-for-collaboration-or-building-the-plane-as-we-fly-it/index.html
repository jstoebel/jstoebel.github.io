  <p>Much like the open source software movement at large, my course  <a href="http://jadud.com/teaching/softeng-sp16/">Software Engineering</a>  will be built from the ground up. This means that, unlike traditional courses we will be defining the terms for success and then be graded on those terms. This is a completely new and perhaps bewildering concept to me but given the democratic nature of the work we are engaging in, it only makes sense that we should be designing the terms for success. Just like it is a programing best practice to create a strong design before sitting down to write code, shouldn't students participate in creating the terms for the course before jumping in to the meat of the course?</p>
<h3>The Expectations</h3>
<p>The other day, the class had a discussion on what behaviors or qualities constitute successful completion of this course (i.e. what would A level work like?).  Many terrific ideas were thrown out. For me the common themes centered on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be accountable to your team: If you said you would do something do it when you said you would. Respect the truth that you have great power to impact the success and joy of others' work.</p></li>
<li><p>Be nice:  It seems to me that to be a software engineer is to deal with the insecurity of not knowing enough. I think this can be healthy in small doses but can become toxic fast. Unfortunately we've all worked with someone who either thinks or does know more than the rest of the group. Knowledge is an asset, but no one wants to work with someone who uses their knowledge to make others feel insecure or worse, to hijack the group's work flow. To me it doesn't really matter how much a person knows if no one wants to collaborate with them to apply that knowledge. So just be nice ok?</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate: This ties back to the first two items. If you're going to be late to a meeting, let everyone know with an apology so they know you respect the group's time. Document your code so other people can follow it and give you feedback. If the group is going in a direction you disagree with, find a way to express that. Your reservations left unsaid could harm the collaboration. Communication is your way of investing your belief in the group's ability to succeed.</p></li>
<li><p>Equality vs "the same": We may not all write the exact same number of lines of code. Some of us might spend more time working on the documentation. Some of us might write more emails to the project leads than others. This is fine. What is not fine is if some of us give more of our time, life and soul to the project than others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow we will firm up our definition for success in this class. It will be exciting to see what we come up with.</p>
<h3>Concerns?</h3>
<p>Thinking back on previous collaborative programming experiences, I can think of some that have been so positive and energetic I couldn't wait to meet with my group and get some work done. It seemed that every interaction was light and fun but also charged with creative energy. Everyone seemed to learn and be inspired from everyone else. I really truly hope I can work with a group like that this semester. That would be the best.</p>
<p>On the other hand I have worked with groups that have been toxic, exhausting and infuriating. I've had partners lecture me like I was a child. Partners who approached our interaction as though they were a Help Desk employee and I a hopeless customer with a busted computer. The disengaged partners, the ones who offer no productive ideas, don't bring any kind of joy or curiosity to the process and generally just nod along, are a drag on the process too. It doesn't matter if they are polite and show up to meetings on time. If they are "meh" about being there, they may as well not be there at all.</p>
<p>I suppose my one concern is, while you can't always have a group that clicks perfectly, what happens if I end up with toxic collaborators? Is there anything the group can do to address it? And what if the group dynamic can't be improved? Can groups evolve their work flow so that work can resume in spite of toxic people? I hope so?</p>
<p>PS: Before I was a software nerd I was a theatre nerd. In that time I came across a <a href="http://lpontius.com/guest-blog-kirk-lynn-thoughts-on-collaboration/">blog post about collaboration</a> that I think applies to any worthwhile human endeavor. In the places where you see words pertaining to theatre, just cross them out and put in a word that more closely fits the world of software engineering. At the end of the day its all just humans working together with tools to make things.</p>
